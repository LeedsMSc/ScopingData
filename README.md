3a. An Excel workbook with the search-terms that we underpinned the searches performed for our scoping review.

3b. An Excel workbook with the Python generated search-strings that we used for our scoping review.

4a. An Excel workbook with an example CSV output that was exported from EndNote 20.

4b. An Excel workbook with an example CSV EndNote 20 output with formatting for readability applied using Python.

5. Excel workbooks containing the search-string results for each respective database search. 
The bracketted numbers in the worksheet name are total rows and columns.

The Python notebooks require access to multiple of these Excel workbooks.  For the Python notebooks to run
without editing the filepath locations, these Excel workbooks should be stored on the desktop in a folder 
called "ScopingData".
